# iOS Week4 Swift Assessment

This assessment is designed to test students' ability to create view controllers, navigation controllers, and nested views in Interface Builder, then combine these elements programmatically.

## Instructions
You are provided two files: `Main.storyboard` and `TestViewController.swift`.

### Storyboard
* In interface builder, add a view controller nested within a navigation controller.
* We'll need to customize the content of the view controller programmatically, so set its class to `TestViewController`.
* Add a table view to this view controller, then connect the table view to `TestViewController` as an `IBOutlet`.

### TestViewController Class
* Add a property to your class file called `electricArray` which contains as a collection each separate word in this sentence: `We're going to rock down to Electric Avenue`
*
